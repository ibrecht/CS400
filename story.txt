Once upon a time there was a guy named Eric. Eric was a foolish fellow who always did foolish things. One rainy day in mid july, Eric decided to ride his bike down the slippery,
wet dirt path near his humble home. 
Sure enough, Eric's bike slipped out from underneath him. He landed flat on his back and the wind was knocked clean out of him. He laid there for a few minutes waiting for the air to come back to his lungs. He then brushed himself off as best as he could and went to check on his bike.

Just like Eric the bike was fine it just had a little dirt on it. But Eric was foolish so he got back on and started to go down again. Again his bike slipped out from underneath him and he crashed to the ground and again he got back up. Eric fell 4 times on his way down the hill that day, it was a big hill and he was very foolish but eventually he made it home.
